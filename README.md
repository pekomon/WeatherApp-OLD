# WeatherApp

## Little application for displaying weather in Android. Fetches data from network and stores it locally. Uses location data to get local weather. 

Uses MVVM architecture with dependency injection implemented using Kodein-DI. Not to forget lifecycle components.

Uses standadrd Navigation components with safe args. 

Has Room database with coroutines in place. 

Uses Glide to download images on runtime. 

Networking is done using Retrofit

Probably forgot something but all the basic blocks should be there. 
Needs some refactoring and updating to newest components and that's why having the "-OLD" suffix.
